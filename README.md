# 📝 Java Task Manager

A simple **Task Manager** built in Java as a learning project. This console-based application helps users create, view, update, and delete tasks—perfect for practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java collections, and basic file handling.

## 📚 Features

* Add new tasks with title, description, and due date
* Mark tasks as complete
* List all tasks or only pending/completed ones
* Edit or delete tasks
* Save/load tasks from a local file

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project was created to explore and practice:

* Java syntax and structure
* OOP principles (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
* Working with collections (e.g., `ArrayList`)
* Input/output with the console and files
* Basic project organization and modularity
